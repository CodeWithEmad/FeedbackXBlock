  <p> This XBlock allows you to collect student feedback on pieces of
    the course. This may be helpful either for course improvement, or
    to give students a chance to reflect on what they have done.</p>
  <p>Please note that the text feedback needs to be analyzed as part
    of the <a href="https://edx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">edX
    research dumps</a>. For now, we do not provide any kind of visual
    analytics associated with this block. We do display numbers of
    students giving specific feedback.</p>
  <p>We do recommend matrix sampling. This can be done by using the
  <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/content_experiments/content_experiments_configure.html">randomized
  control trials framework</a>.</p>
  <p> We suggest asking specific questions which provide students
  clear guidance. For the Likert prompt, it is helpful to be very
  specific: Was this assignment easy to understand? Was the length
  appropriate? For the freeform response, you should provide students
  clear guidance on what kind of feedback you would like.</p>
